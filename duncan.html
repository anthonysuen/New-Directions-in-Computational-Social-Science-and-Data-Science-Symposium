          <h4>Should social science be problem oriented?</h4>
          <h4>Duncan Watts</h4>
          <p>Over the past 100 years social science has generated a tremendous number
of theories of individual and collective human behavior. In general, however,
it has not produced anything resembling a "core" of cohesive and consistent
theoretical knowledge that is both generally agreed upon and also empirically
validated. There are many reasons for this state of affairs, including that
social phenomena are almost always complex and multiscale; that social data
have historically been extremely hard to collect at scale; and that social
experiments have been difficult or impossible to conduct. Recently the
combination of vastly increased computing power, "big data," and "virtual
labs"---aka computational social science---has generated considerable
excitement on the grounds that the lifting of these historical barriers
may lead to a revolution in social science. In this talk, however, I
claim that social science is also hampered by its traditional emphasis
on advancing theoretical (or methodological) frameworks rather than
solving practical problems. To be truly revolutionary, I argue,
computational social science should reverse this traditional importance
ranking, starting first with a problem and then asking what theories
(and methods) must be brought to bear to solve it. I then offer a few
suggestions regarding which problems we should pick and how we should
organize ourselves to solve them.</p>
