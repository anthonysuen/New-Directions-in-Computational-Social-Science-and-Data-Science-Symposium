What the Crowd Knows About the Crowd

I will discuss online and field experiments that examine people's knowledge
of others' behaviors and network positions.   I will discuss differences in
how populations from different countries behave in coordination games and
how these are driven by differences in beliefs and customs.   I will also
discuss how people come to learn about others' behaviors and positions in
a society.
