Counterfactual Inference Using Behavioral Models: An Application to Search Advertising
Susan Athey

When designing online advertising markets, it is challenging to use A/B testing to
learn about the effects of policy changes.  An alternative is to build a statistical
model and infer advertiser preferences, and use this model to estimate the effect of
counterfactual policies.  An important characteristic of a successful model is that
it accounts for heterogeneity in advertiser objectives as well as in the magnitudes
of the parameters of their preferences.  We apply this method to a data set of search
advertisers using a large-scale Bayesian model.  Results include the finding that
advertisers who use "exact match" bidding tend to value impressions rather than clicks.
We also evaluate revenue/efficiency tradeoffs involved in improved targeting of
advertisements to users.
