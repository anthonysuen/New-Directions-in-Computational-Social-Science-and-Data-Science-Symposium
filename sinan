Peer Effects, Social Influence and Population Scale Behavior Change
Sinan Aral

In this talk, I will survey empirical approaches to causal inference
in networks and describe a series of large-scale randomized experiments
and causal observational studies of peer influence to explore the
behavioral dynamics catalyzed by peer effects or social spillovers
in human behavior and opinion formation. I will discuss implications
of peer effects for bias in online ratings, social advertising, human
health interdependence and the ability to generate cascades of behavior
through peer to peer influence in networks.
