Understanding Social Behavior During Crisis Events using Digital Traces
Emma Spiro

ocial media have become an established feature of the dynamic information
space that emerges during crisis events. Both emergency responders and the
public use these platforms to search for, disseminate, challenge, and make
sense of information during crises. In this talk, I will review the social
processes that unfold in communities during disaster events and how these
processes can be studied at scale with behavioral trace data. I illustrate
this approach in studies of rumoring behavior and mass convergence of attention.
Understanding these processes has important practical implications for effectively
leveraging social media for emergency management.
