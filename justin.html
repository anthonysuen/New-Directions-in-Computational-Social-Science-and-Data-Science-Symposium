          <h4>Discovery of Treatments from Text Corpora</h4>
          <h4>Justin Grimmer</h4>
          <p>An extensive literature in computational social science examines how features
of messages, advertisements, and other corpora affect individuals’ decisions,
but these analyses must specify the relevant features of the text before the
experiment. Automated text analysis methods are able to discover features of
text, but these methods cannot be used to obtain the estimates of causal
effects—the quantity of interest for applied researchers. We introduce a new
experimental design and statistical model to simultaneously discover treatments
in a corpora and estimate causal effects for these discovered treatments.
We prove the conditions to identify the treatment effects of texts and
introduce the supervised Indian Buffet process to discover those treatments.
Our method enables us to discover treatments in a training set using a collection
of texts and individuals’ responses to those texts, and then estimate the effects
of these interventions in a test set of new texts and survey respondents.
We apply the model to an experiment about candidate biographies, recovering
intuitive features of voters’ decisions and revealing a penalty for lawyers
and a bonus for military service.</p>
