The Fragility of Organizations: A Simulation and Empirical Examples
Bruce Kogut

The social science of networks is rich in theory and findings on the effect
of structure and topology on performance and behavior.   Structural holes,
weak ties, small worlds, and scale free graphs are examples of network
positions or topologies that are frequently studied.    The empirical
evidence for topological effects has been surprisingly mixed.
We argue that these contradictory results occur because they reflect
an important property of organizations, that is, their fragility.
We analyze fragility through a agent-based simulation that begins
with the broader observation that organizations are fragile because
they are social communities.   In our approach, since the "social"
precedes the "structural," it is not surprising that efforts at
organizational design often rely upon such concepts as "socialization"
(that is creating homophily) or "teams" (that is creating cohesion).
These mechanisms, that is, homophily or cohesion, generate structures
that can thwart, or promote, subsequent advantages to an organization.
We identify a "sweet spot" where the tendency towards homophily and
to cohesion is just "right," creating a structure that facilitates
knowledge sharing.  In the economics literature on organizational
design, this coupling of two mechanisms to generate an "additional
supra" effect is an example of complementarities.  We analyze the
effects of these two mechanisms through a sociological simulation
that we call the "knowledge transfer game."  To illustrate these ideas,
we will draw from empirical studies on auto productivity, microfinance,
and restaurants.  [Co-authors: Jerry Kim, Jae-Suk Yang].
